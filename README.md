# Macropad RGB Multipress

Thank you for checking out my first project for the macropad!

**Currently there is a bug where, if a function that calls 2 parameters is assigned to a key, pressing the key will cause the function to be called repeatedly, regardless of the state machnine. Pressing another key will terminate the behaviour. I am not a python programmer so it might be something basic** 

After downloading the code, you shall experience a rich feature set, such as: 

- Dynamic colours: colours for each key will blend to and from the colours you set, at a rate defined by the COLOUR_RATE constant
- Multipress: Multiple keys may be pressed at once. Pressed-down keys will be highlighted white for user feedback
- Key repeats: Keys will execute a function specified by the user when pressed. If they are pressed for long enough, that function will be executed repeatedly until it is released

More features on the way!
