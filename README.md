# Macropad RGB Multipress

Thank you for checking out my first project for the macropad!

After downloading the code, you shall experience a rich feature set, such as: 

- Dynamic colours: colours for each key will blend to and from the colours you set, at a rate defined by the COLOUR_RATE constant
- Multipress: Multiple keys may be pressed at once. Pressed-down keys will be highlighted white for user feedback
- Key repeats: Keys will execute a function specified by the user when pressed. If they are pressed for long enough, that function will be executed repeatedly until it is released

More features on the way!
